AcademyAutomate: Because no one should have to sit through 150 presentations with 25 slides each where each slide takes about 5-7 seconds to load!!

**IMPORTANT**
Some of the variables in this program differ from screen to screen so you need to follow the steps in this video to set it up for yourself:

It takes only 10 minutes and no coding is required!!

**Error in the Tutorial**
In the tutorial video attached, there are several instances where I close the script/exe file using the 'system tray'. Unfortunately, you will probably not be able to do that unless you have the 'autohotkey' software installed. Instead you will have to close the script using taskmanager. Sorry about that :P

**List of Topics this Script Won't be Able to Help With**
i) Any topics that are under 'Session 0' in the courses (you can just complete them by opening the pdf files in there and closing it so that shouldn't be a problem)
ii) Topics that are either marked as 'Completed' or 'Incomplete' (topics you haven't touched yet won't be marked at all)
iii) Quizes (You are welcome to implement a screen reader into this which would probably make it even go through the topics in point i) and ii))

**Before Running the Main 'Run.exe' File Watch the Tutorial**

**Shortcuts Keys:**
⊞ Win + N (when 'Scroll.exe' is active) = Scroll Down (by 1)
⊞ Win + N (when 'Run.exe' is active) = Start the Automated Process
Ctrl + LeftClick (when 'Coords.exe' is active) = Coordinates of the Point at Which You Clicked

**DO NOT KEEP ANY OF THE 2 EXE FILES ACTIVE AT THE SAME TIME OR IT MAY CAUSE CONFLICT**
